| “Product broke after a few months. It was still under warranty, but they want the consumer to pay them an extra $15 to fix their mistakes. Also it smudges, doesn’t eliminate odor, and the motion sensor frequently sets itself off. They decided to put the close button and the locking mechanism on opposite sides of the sensor, so when you press the close button it immediately reopens when you move your hand to lock the lid. This a bad product sold by an even worse company.”               | Product should last longer than a few months,  Product should not stain easily,  The product’s sensors should only go off when desired,   Product should have intuitive design. |
| “The product description states 13 gallon however, the actual size is much smaller. I would have returned the item due to the ridiculous size difference but my husband had already torn the box and Home Depot stated I couldn’t return it without the box. It was a project just to assemble the trash can as well. Too many tiny screws!!!” | The product should be clear in its sizing,  The product should be easy to assemble for the customer,  The product should be easy to assemble for the customer |
| “NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I never ordered a trash bin before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I assumed that a 13 gallon was the average size for kitchen trash bins but this just seems extremely small to me. I made this purchase knowing that it was motion sensing and odorless technology so I expected it to either be battery operated or plug - in. It is plug in... But you have to purchase the AC adapter separately as well as everything else that makes it "techy". So for the price I paid I just received a regular trash bin that I have to manually open and deal with smells unless I buy the rest of the kit. I'll be returning this as soon as possible and I will purchase a regular trash bin instead for much cheaper. Lesson learned.”                |  The product should not be too small to be used,   The product should be able to easily be powered,  The product should be battery operated or plug into a power source.  The product should be affordable |

| “Absolutely love , love this can. You have to purchase 4 D batteries and or online get an adapter that is made for it.”               | The product is easy to recharge |
| “The can arrived packaged very well. This is very important because you aren't immediately worried about a damaged product. This is a very sturdy and decorative indoor waste can. Easy to clean. I love how the cover opens and closes automatically ( I purchased the adapter) and that it has its own deodorizer. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is more attractive than a plain plastic trash can. Would recommend this product very highly.” | The Product uses D Batteries, Product is not damaged, Product is sturdy, Product is aesthetically pleasing, Product is automatic, Product does not take up much space, Product deodors itself |
| “This is a terrific product for your kitchen especially or any place that needs a large disposal. We had the previous generation can for about 20 years ( needing to replace the opening top after about 10 years). Quality is very good. Sensor works well and keeps the lid open for about 6 seconds allowing you to dispose most anything without touching any buttons. Nothing to lift or pedal to push to get it open. Bags can be removed easily and new one replaced in a jiffy. Definitely recommend.”                | Product should have a long lifespan, up to 10 years. Product should minimize manual steps, Product should allow easy replacement of contents  |

| “Cute but VERY small; if you use this for anything but hair strands %26 used floss, you will be emptying it quite often. Fortunately that's about all we put in our bathroom trash, so it works for us.”               | The product is too small,  The product has low capacity |

| “As a gadget junkie, I couldn't resist trying out this trash can—even though I didn't necessarily need it. Its slim and sleek design fits perfectly next to my kitchen setup without being an eyesore. What really sets it apart are the high-tech features: it seals itself with heat, lifts and lowers automatically, and even replaces the bag—super cool! My only minor complaint is that I wish the opening were a bit wider. The Motion sensor works accordingly and it seems to be sturdy. I purchased this item on sale so the value for me was okay.”               | The product should be sleek.  The product should automatically do as many tasks as possible.  The product’s opening should be wide.  The product should be priced as low as possible. |
| “I really love this garbage can. Once I figured out what “full” looks like for the automatic sealing mechanism, it’s been everything I hoped for. A helpful tip: if the bag doesn’t cut cleanly after sealing, it’s probably slightly overfilled—just press down the top a bit manually, and it should work perfectly.    One of the best features is the rechargeable battery. I honestly forget it even needs charging because it lasts for months—I think it’s been at least 3 months since the last charge.   The lights inside the can are a cute touch, though they’re more for novelty than practical use. I did knock off one star because the motion sensor isn’t quite sensitive enough. I usually have to wave my hand right up close—or even touch it—to get the lid to open. Overall, it’s a fantastic product with smart features and a sleek design. Just wish the motion sensor worked a little better!” | The product should have a long battery life.  The product should allow the user to correct basic mistakes.  The product should provide illumination.  The product’s sensors should be sensitive enough to properly detect what they are looking for. |
| “Had this trash can for well over a year now. So much better than Simple Human. Love that out has an open lid mode and bags the trash and refills the bag. It talks to me like a robot. Super awesome. Also freaks out the cat, which is always amusing. The sensor also works consistently, unlike our SH can in the kitchen. Also like that is rechargeable and I don't have to recharge it often; I recharge it a few times a year. This trash can is just cool - I LOVE IT! ❤️ Smart people designed it.”                |  The product’s sensors should work consistently.  The product should be power efficient.  The product should last for as long as possible. |

| “Complete rip off, do not buy. 1st, I've never understood why vendors will sometimes take a small box and put it inside a box 3x its size without padding to ship an item. This is far worse than just shipping the original box on its own. The item is going to bang around inside that larger box and the shippers have no idea the thing that matters is inside the larger box. So naturally it came and the interior box that was taped up 1000x to hold it together for shipping was super damaged. This is the mark of a company that has no idea what its doing. Secondly, I have never, in trying 5 times, had a bag seal itself up after pressing the button. It opens and the bag is 30% sealed and that seal breaks as soon as you look at it. Thirdly, the opening to this trash bin is too narrow so its often not very helpful when you want to dispose of trash. Fourthly, the sensor used to open the top lid is often on strike. It simply refuses to acknowledge my presence. I need to perform some type of ritualistic dance to get the thing to open up .”               | The product should be able to ship without damage.  The product should be able to perform its functions reliably.  The product should be sized properly for its function.  The sensors for the product should function reliably. |
| “I had high hopes for the Airdeer Automatic Trash Can, but unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its promising features, this 4-gallon self-sealing and self-changing smart trash can has not lived up to my expectations.” | The product should promptly respond to the user.  
The product should have its mechanisms work reliably. |
| “Firstly, the motion sensor is extremely finicky. Sometimes it responds, but more often than not, I find myself waving my hand multiple times just to get it to open. This defeats the purpose of a touchless trash can and has become quite frustrating.”                |  The product should not have flimsy components |
| “The self-sealing and self-changing mechanism is another major issue. It frequently jams and fails to seal properly, leaving me with a mess to clean up. The trash bags are also quite flimsy and tear easily, which is not what I expected from a product designed for convenience.”                |  The product has multiple design flaws that make it not work properly. |
| “Additionally, the lid doesn't always close securely, leading to unpleasant odors escaping into the kitchen. For a trash can with a lid, this is a fundamental flaw.”                |  The product should have easily replaceable and cheap internals, if they need to be replaced at all |
| “The refill rings are supposed to make things easier, but they are overpriced and don't last nearly as long as advertised. I find myself constantly needing to replace them, adding to the overall cost and hassle.”                |  The product's complements are not worth their price |
