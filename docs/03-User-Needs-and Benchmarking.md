| “Product broke after a few months. It was still under warranty, but they want the consumer to pay them an extra $15 to fix their mistakes. Also it smudges, doesn’t eliminate odor, and the motion sensor frequently sets itself off. They decided to put the close button and the locking mechanism on opposite sides of the sensor, so when you press the close button it immediately reopens when you move your hand to lock the lid. This a bad product sold by an even worse company.”               | Product should last longer than a few months,  Product should not stain easily,  The product’s sensors should only go off when desired,   Product should have intuitive design. |
| “The product description states 13 gallon however, the actual size is much smaller. I would have returned the item due to the ridiculous size difference but my husband had already torn the box and Home Depot stated I couldn’t return it without the box. It was a project just to assemble the trash can as well. Too many tiny screws!!!” | The product should be clear in its sizing,  The product should be easy to assemble for the customer,  The product should be easy to assemble for the customer |
| “NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I never ordered a trash bin before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I assumed that a 13 gallon was the average size for kitchen trash bins but this just seems extremely small to me. I made this purchase knowing that it was motion sensing and odorless technology so I expected it to either be battery operated or plug - in. It is plug in... But you have to purchase the AC adapter separately as well as everything else that makes it "techy". So for the price I paid I just received a regular trash bin that I have to manually open and deal with smells unless I buy the rest of the kit. I'll be returning this as soon as possible and I will purchase a regular trash bin instead for much cheaper. Lesson learned.”                |  The product should not be too small to be used,   The product should be able to easily be powered,  The product should be battery operated or plug into a power source.  The product should be affordable |

| “Absolutely love , love this can. You have to purchase 4 D batteries and or online get an adapter that is made for it.”               | The product is easy to recharge |
| “The can arrived packaged very well. This is very important because you aren't immediately worried about a damaged product. This is a very sturdy and decorative indoor waste can. Easy to clean. I love how the cover opens and closes automatically ( I purchased the adapter) and that it has its own deodorizer. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is more attractive than a plain plastic trash can. Would recommend this product very highly.” | The Product uses D Batteries, Product is not damaged, Product is sturdy, Product is aesthetically pleasing, Product is automatic, Product does not take up much space, Product deodors itself |
| “This is a terrific product for your kitchen especially or any place that needs a large disposal. We had the previous generation can for about 20 years ( needing to replace the opening top after about 10 years). Quality is very good. Sensor works well and keeps the lid open for about 6 seconds allowing you to dispose most anything without touching any buttons. Nothing to lift or pedal to push to get it open. Bags can be removed easily and new one replaced in a jiffy. Definitely recommend.”                | Product should have a long lifespan, up to 10 years. Product should minimize manual steps, Product should allow easy replacement of contents  |

| “I bought 2 of them. They are strudy trash cans just smaller than I thought but still useful for the bathroom.” | Good for bathroom use. 
Good in pairs.
