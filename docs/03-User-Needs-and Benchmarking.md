| “Absolutely love , love this can. You have to purchase 4 D batteries and or online get an adapter that is made for it.”               | The product is easy to recharge |
| “The can arrived packaged very well. This is very important because you aren't immediately worried about a damaged product. This is a very sturdy and decorative indoor waste can. Easy to clean. I love how the cover opens and closes automatically ( I purchased the adapter) and that it has its own deodorizer. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is more attractive than a plain plastic trash can. Would recommend this product very highly.” | The Product uses D Batteries, Product is not damaged, Product is sturdy, Product is aesthetically pleasing, Product is automatic, Product does not take up much space, Product deodors itself |
| “This is a terrific product for your kitchen especially or any place that needs a large disposal. We had the previous generation can for about 20 years ( needing to replace the opening top after about 10 years). Quality is very good. Sensor works well and keeps the lid open for about 6 seconds allowing you to dispose most anything without touching any buttons. Nothing to lift or pedal to push to get it open. Bags can be removed easily and new one replaced in a jiffy. Definitely recommend.”                | Product should have a long lifespan, up to 10 years. Product should minimize manual steps, Product should allow easy replacement of contents  |
