# Product Requirements


## Project Objective

This project aims to develop and explore the capabilities of automating household chores to provide more convenience to customers, as well as improving user experience when using an automatic trashcan. The goal is to establish a niche in the market for customers interested in convenient solutions to household chores, generate enough sales to turn a profit and establish ourselves in the space, and push consumers away from traditional trashcans and towards higher end, more convenient products. We believe that, if the product can be priced low enough to compete with standard trash cans, that at least 10% of the target customer group could become more interested in our product than the lower end competitors. 


## Stakeholders



* **Target group** Middle and high income homeowners or renters of any age who are constantly busy or struggle to perform household tasks. The main benefit sought after is convenience.
* **Target purchaser** Target group profile with special attention to busy young adults.
* **Customer service** Prefers easy-to-repair, and easy-to-fix complaints to further the goal of providing convenience.
* **Retailers** Prefer products that can be easily stored and packaged, as well as durable enough to survive shipping without being damaged, as well as survive in various environments, such as high temperature, humidity, and elevation, while not being a target for vandalism or theft.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Harriet**

Harriet is an 83-year-old retired teacher who enjoys staying active through hobbies like origami and simple paper crafts. While she has mild arthritis in both of her hands, she manages her day to day tasks with little difficulty. However, by the end of the week, taking out the trash becomes a challenging task. The action of pulling the drawstrings on a trash bag and tying them does cause her some discomfort in her hands. To ease this struggle, Harrietâ€™s new self seal trash can has no pull, no tie feature that lets her complete this chore with ease. This small improvement allows her to maintain her house with less discomfort.

**User Story #2: Sam**

Sam is a busy nursing student who works long shifts at a hospital. His days are packed with responsibilities, and when he's home, he tries his best to keep up with his household chores. One task he often forgets about is taking out the trash. By the time he gets to it, the smell can be unbearable, especially after a long shift. To make things easier, Sam uses a self-sealing trash can. When the bag reaches a certain fullness, it automatically seals itself shut, locking in any odors and preventing any mess from spilling over. This feature means Sam doesn't have to worry about forgetting to take the trash out immediately or dealing with lingering smells. The self sealing trash can gives him one less thing to worry about during his busy, tiring days.


## Aspects

The new product design will be based on other automatic trash cans that were found on the internet, with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

    * 1.4 The product shall be durable so that it can withstand some abuse and still retain its functionality. (P10)
    * 1.5 The product shall make it easy for the user to replace the bag. (P10)
* **Functionality**
    * 2.1 The product shall be equipped with a motion sensor to open only when the user wants to throw some garbage away. (P10)
    * 2.2 The product shall sense when the can is reaching maximum capacity and seal the bag to be removed. (P9)
    * 2.3 The product shall notify the user when the can has reached maximum capacity and needs to be replaced (P10)

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

For the criteria requirements for this product, there are five categories or sections. Convenience or automation, the standalone functionality of the product without intervention. User experience, which goes hand in hand with the previous point but focuses on providing an outstanding experience rather than simply having a functional product. The third point would be market competitiveness or cost. Durability and reliability, the product's ability to continue functioning despite damage or the passage of time.



1. Convenience/ Automation

	The lid should open on average 1 second after the sensor detects the user's hand 20 centimetres away from it.



2. User Experience

	The product is capable of completing the entire process of opening and closing the lid without exceeding 40 decibels at 1 meter.



3. Market Competitiveness

	The cost of production must not exceed 50% of the cost of sale.



4. Durability/Reliability

	The product should continue to function after being sprayed with a hose, dragged on the ground and knocked down multiple times. (Undetermined periods of time)


## Open Questions

* Can we ensure our product is able to be used with normal trash bags?
* Can we enlarge the technology to use this as a normal trash can, rather than a very small one?
