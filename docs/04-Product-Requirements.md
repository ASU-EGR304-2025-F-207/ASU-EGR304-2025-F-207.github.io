## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra’s lifestyle products.

## Stakeholders

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Harriet**
Harriet is an 83-year-old retired teacher who enjoys staying active through hobbies like origami and simple paper crafts. While she has mild arthritis in both of her hands, she manages her day to day tasks with little difficulty. However, by the end of the week, taking out the trash becomes a challenging task. The action of pulling the drawstrings on a trash bag and tying them does cause her some discomfort in her hands. To ease this struggle, Harriet’s new self seal trash can has no pull, no tie feature that lets her complete this chore with ease. This small improvement allows her to maintain her house with less discomfort.

**User Story #2: Sam**
Sam is a busy nursing student who works long shifts at a hospital. His days are packed with responsibilities, and when he's home, he tries his best to keep up with his household chores. One task he often forgets about is taking out the trash. By the time he gets to it, the smell can be unbearable, especially after a long shift. To make things easier, Sam uses a self-sealing trash can. When the bag reaches a certain fullness, it automatically seals itself shut, locking in any odors and preventing any mess from spilling over. This feature means Sam doesn't have to worry about forgetting to take the trash out immediately or dealing with lingering smells. The self sealing trash can gives him one less thing to worry about during his busy, tiring days.


## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of the AirPods with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

1. **Producr Design**
   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing AirPods as well as main competitors Sony WF-1000XM3, Jabra Elite, Amazon Echo Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and Bose SoundSport Free, and Urbanista Stockholm. (P10)
   * 1.1 The product shall be easy to recognize as an Apple product without needing a logo on its exterior. (P10)
   * 1.2. The product shall avoid styling elements from our Powerbeats over-ear wireless headphones since those address a different market segment. (P8)
  
1. **Functionality**
      * 2.1 The product shall incorporate one or more optical proximity sensors to detect the user wearing it. (P10)
      * 2.2 The product shall offer a dual microphone in each earbud. (P10)

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power from 9 volts to 5 volts
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed 1.5 amps.

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on failing or self-igniting batteries?
