title: Team Block Diagram
---

The block diagram was designed with ease of connectivity in mind. Our product consists of two subsystems: the motor and the LED scale. Each of these outputs is connected to its associated sensor: the motion sensor and the force and distance sensors, respectively. Each block diagram is connected to the others to ensure a common ground voltage. Each diagram indicates the power level used by the components, as well as the specific component used for each part of the diagram, and to which pins the components are connected.
