title: Team Block Diagram
---

The block diagram was designed with ease of connectivity in mind. We seperated our product into two subsystems, the motor and LED scale. Each of these output are connected to their associated sensors, the motion and the force and distance sensors respectively. Each block diagram is connected to each other to ensure a common ground voltage. Each diagram indicates the power level that the componenets use, as well as the specific component used in for each part of the diagram, and to what pins the components are connected.
