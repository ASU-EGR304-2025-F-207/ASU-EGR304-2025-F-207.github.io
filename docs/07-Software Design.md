# Software Design

This activity diagram illustrates the software workflow for the motion sensor, weight sensor, distance sensor, and motor/LED control logic. The logic was decided upon during the initial formation of the idea, and simply elaborated upon for the formal software proposal. The main loop, on the left side, represents the overall flow of the project, cycling the sensors and actuators. The details of each microcontroller (MCU) are elaborated on the right. The microcontroller subsystems appear in the order they are shown on the diagram, and are numbered in the order they appear on the block diagram. The software meets the product requirements by connecting all the team's microcontrollers together, and by enabling the proper sensing and actuating on each member's subsystem.

Potential for improvement:

If this software were to undergo improvements, there are multiple avenues to streamline the software process. One primary change would be to connect the motion and distance subsystem to all three other microcontrollers, and eliminate the connection between the LED scale and force sensor subsystem and the speaker subsystem. This was initially done because the team had already set up the connections, but were told that we had to change our subsystems in order to fulfill class requirements. This led to the inefficient connection, which should be removed if there was another opportunity to connect to update the design. In addition, the exact weight metrics should be ironed out in order to be able to accommodate multiple different bag strengths, and accurately identify them using the force sensor. Another change would be to the logic of the speaker. Ideally, the speaker should serve as a reminder that the trash is full, and the bag needs to be replaced. However, the current set up only has the speaker go off once when the trash can is full. Ideally, a different timer would be added to the speaker to go off once every few minutes, or a few times an hour, in order to serve as a more persistent reminder to the consumer, rather than a single warning.
