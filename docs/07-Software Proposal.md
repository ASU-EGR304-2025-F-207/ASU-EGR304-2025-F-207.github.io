# Software Proposal

This activity diagram illustrates the software workflow for the motion sensor, weight sensor, distance sensor, and motor/LED control logic. The logic was decided upon during the initial formation of the idea, and simply elaborated upon for the formal software proposal. The two different logic branches reflect the two seperate subsystems that our design contains, allowing both to run simultaneously, without interrupting the other.
