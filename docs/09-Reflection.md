## Lessons Learned

 Throughout this semester, we have experienced many things that have taught us alternative or more efficient ways of working and achieving results. These lessons are valuable for the future; they are an experience. We can highlight basic aspects, such as punctuality and communication, or more complex concepts, including the proper use of laboratory equipment, both within and outside the lab. One of the most important lessons we learned was the importance of time management. If you maintain a good work pace and keep track of deadlines, time becomes a resource, not a burden. EGR is a demanding course that combines hardware and software labs, circuit design and construction, and coding. For this reason, it is advisable, if not necessary, to review the material outside of class time. Teamwork is one of the most important aspects of engineering, and it is most evident when external support is needed. Being able to learn, ask for help from your teammates or classmates, and provide support to them in return are invaluable skills. Another thing to consider is working with limited parts or components. Whenever possible, you should anticipate potential human error and work around it. This could be something as simple as losing parts or accidentally damaging them.

To all of this, we must add the complexity of the software required for this class. The software used in this class is easy to use, but it is generally considered complex for newcomers or those unfamiliar with it, requiring time and effort to become proficient. When designing the initial product, it is necessary to consider not only what you want to create but also the project's complexity and the individual and collective capabilities of each group member. In our case, we sought something that was considered relatively simple to accomplish yet still presented a suitable level of challenge for us. Being aware of one's own capabilities is very important. Classes like this are not the only aspect of life; you also have a social, personal, and in some cases, professional life that needs to be balanced with your academic life. You need to be able to maintain this balance to perform at your best.

   
## Recommendations for Future Students

1. Dedicate 1 to 2 hours before each lab to review the course material and get ahead in the learning process to perform more efficiently.
2. Maintaining effective communication with teammates is crucial for good performance.
3. The goal should be to work ahead. Aiming to be one lab ahead or to have half of it completed before class increases the chances of success.
4. The software is difficult to learn; dedicating time to understanding and practicing it is crucial.
5. Office classes are highly recommended for this course, rather than one-on-one sessions with the professor. Office hours are a space outside of class for you to continue working with the professor, who is available to address any questions that may arise.
