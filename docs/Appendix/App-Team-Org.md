### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is Text.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. Each class, we will meet in person to discuss changes and activities for that day and/or week. The default method of remote communication is text for any needs, help, comments, etc.

2. If direct communication with the professor is required, the entire group will be present. If only one person needs to speak to the professor, Gael Chavez will be the group's spokesperson and responsible for informing them of the discussion.

## Team Coordination & Accountability

1. We will ensure that each team member has "signed off" on each assignment by sending a message in the group text asking if everyone accepts with the state of the assignment. If everyone agrees or the assignment is within 10 minutes of being due with no objections, the assignment will be considered "signed off" by everyone. Hattie will be turning in the assignment once it is signed off by everyone.
2. As our team works on each assignment, members will speak up if they are not capable of performing any tasks for that assignment, either from lack of skill or knowledge. If no members are able to confidently perform a task, one member will be selected to work on that section, with the others covering more work to allow that member to learn the necessary skills for that task.
3. Feedback from the design review will be discussed by the team when we meet after the feedback is given. It is the responsibility of each member to act on that feedback; however, other members should speak up and point out if feedback is being ignored.
4. If a team member is underperforming, the team will discuss with them to ascertain why this is occurring, and the team will do as necessary to accommodate and help the team member. The underperforming team member may be asked to take slightly more work in future assignments to balance out the workload over the course of the semester. If a team member does not improve after two or more assignments or two weeks, whichever is longer, the other team members may separately discuss giving that member of the team a pink slip. If two of the three other members agree, a pink slip will be given to the underperforming team member.


## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

Any minor conflicts that can be solved through typical communication channels should be handled through text or face to face conversations. Any team member in conflict with another will be able to ask for 5 minutes after class to discuss the conflict with the team. A conflict can be escalated to the instructor if the conflict has not been resolved for a period of 2 weeks or two assignments, whichever is longer, or if the conflict is preventing the completion of an assignment or at least two team members believe that the quality of an assignment will be compromised by the conflict.
