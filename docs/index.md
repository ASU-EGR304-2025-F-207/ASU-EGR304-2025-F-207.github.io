## Team Introduction

Our team consists of four student engineers from Arizona State University. We are currently designing and building the components of a smart trash can. The projectâ€™s goal is to simplify the chore of taking out the trash. This will help busy individuals and families with their daily routines. The final product will automatically open, sense when full, and alert the user when a new bag is needed. For reviewing the project documentation, use the tabs at the top of the screen or the three line menu in the top-left corner, which shows more tabs for the following sections: [Team Organization](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/02-Team-Organization/), [User Needs and Benchmarking](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/), [Product Requirements](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/04-Product-Requirements/), [Design Ideation](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/05-design-ideation/), [Team Block Diagram](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/06-team-block-diagram/), and [Software Proposal](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/07-Software%20Proposal/). Supporting details and technical data are available by using that same menu within the Appendix.
