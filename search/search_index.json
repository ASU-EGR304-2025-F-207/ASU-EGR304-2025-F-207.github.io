It was still under warranty, but they want the consumer to pay them an extra $15 to fix their mistakes. Also it smudges, doesn\u2019t eliminate odor, and the motion sensor frequently sets itself off. They decided to put the close button and the locking mechanism on opposite sides of the sensor, so when you press the close button it immediately reopens when you move your hand to lock the lid.

I never ordered a trash bin before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I assumed that a 13 gallon was the average size for kitchen trash bins but this just seems extremely small to me. I made this purchase knowing that it was motion sensing and odorless technology so I expected it to either be battery operated or plug - in. It is plug in... But you have to purchase the AC adapter separately as well as everything else that makes it \"techy\". So for the price I paid I just received a regular trash bin that I have to manually open and deal with smells unless I buy the rest of the kit. I'll be returning this as soon as possible and I will purchase a regular trash bin instead for much cheaper. Lesson learned.\u201d The product should not be too small to be used,   The product should be able to easily be powered,  The product should be battery operated or plug into a power source.

Its slim and sleek design fits perfectly next to my kitchen setup without being an eyesore. What really sets it apart are the high-tech features: it seals itself with heat, lifts and lowers automatically, and even replaces the bag\u2014super cool! My only minor complaint is that I wish the opening were a bit wider. The Motion sensor works accordingly and it seems to be sturdy. I purchased this item on sale so the value for me was okay.\u201d The product should be sleek.  The product should automatically do as many tasks as possible.  The product\u2019s opening should be wide.  The product should be priced as low as possible. \u201cI really love this garbage can. Once I figured out what \u201cfull\u201d looks like for the automatic sealing mechanism, it\u2019s been everything I hoped for. A helpful tip: if the bag doesn\u2019t cut cleanly after sealing, it\u2019s probably slightly overfilled\u2014just press down the top a bit manually, and it should work perfectly.    One of the best features is the rechargeable battery. I honestly forget it even needs charging because it lasts for months\u2014I think it\u2019s been at least 3 months since the last charge.   The lights inside the can are a cute touch, though they\u2019re more for novelty than practical use. I did knock off one star because the motion sensor isn\u2019t quite sensitive enough. I usually have to wave my hand right up close\u2014or even touch it\u2014to get the lid to open. Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic product with smart features and a sleek design. Just wish the motion sensor worked a little better!\u201d The product should have a long battery life.  The product should allow the user to correct basic mistakes.  The product should provide illumination.  The product\u2019s sensors should be sensitive enough to properly detect what they are looking for. \u201cHad this trash can for well over a year now. So much better than Simple Human. Love that out has an open lid mode and bags the trash and refills the bag. It talks to me like a robot. Super awesome. Also freaks out the cat, which is always amusing. The sensor also works consistently, unlike our SH can in the kitchen. Also like that is rechargeable and I don't have to recharge it often; I recharge it a few times a year. This trash can is just cool - I LOVE IT! \u2764\ufe0f Smart people designed it.\u201d The product\u2019s sensors should work consistently.  The product should be power efficient.

This is far worse than just shipping the original box on its own. The item is going to bang around inside that larger box and the shippers have no idea the thing that matters is inside the larger box. So naturally it came and the interior box that was taped up 1000x to hold it together for shipping was super damaged. This is the mark of a company that has no idea what its doing. Secondly, I have never, in trying 5 times, had a bag seal itself up after pressing the button. It opens and the bag is 30% sealed and that seal breaks as soon as you look at it. Thirdly, the opening to this trash bin is too narrow so its often not very helpful when you want to dispose of trash. Fourthly, the sensor used to open the top lid is often on strike. It simply refuses to acknowledge my presence. I need to perform some type of ritualistic dance to get the thing to open up .\u201d The product should be able to ship without damage.  The product should be able to perform its functions reliably.  The product should be sized properly for its function.  The sensors for the product should function reliably. \u201cI had high hopes for the Airdeer Automatic Trash Can, but unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its promising features, this 4-gallon self-sealing and self-changing smart trash can has not lived up to my expectations.\u201d The product should promptly respond to the user. The product should have its mechanisms work reliably. \u201cFirstly, the motion sensor is extremely finicky. Sometimes it responds, but more often than not, I find myself waving my hand multiple times just to get it to open. This defeats the purpose of a touchless trash can and has become quite frustrating.\u201d The product should not have flimsy components \u201cThe self-sealing and self-changing mechanism is another major issue. It frequently jams and fails to seal properly, leaving me with a mess to clean up. The trash bags are also quite flimsy and tear easily, which is not what I expected from a product designed for convenience.\u201d The product has multiple design flaws that make it not work properly. \u201cAdditionally, the lid doesn't always close securely, leading to unpleasant odors escaping into the kitchen. For a trash can with a lid, this is a fundamental flaw.\u201d The product should have easily replaceable and cheap internals, if they need to be replaced at all \u201cThe refill rings are supposed to make things easier, but they are overpriced and don't last nearly as long as advertised.

adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra\u2019s lifestyle products.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<ul> <li>Target group High-income upper-class professionals between the age of 20 and 45.
