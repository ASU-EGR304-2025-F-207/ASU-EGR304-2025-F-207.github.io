Initially, our requirements were broad, but as we worked on the block diagram and examined how each subsystem functioned, we had to make more precise decisions. Performance needs drove us to improve sensor accuracy, reduce noise, and enhance the reliability of our automatic features. Usability needs led us to focus on making the system easy to operate and assemble, which in turn influenced how we structured our connections and message flow. Durability issues helped us identify problems such as flimsy parts and potential wear, which led us to select stronger components. Overall, our process evolved from general ideas to a more organized and practical design that better aligns with how the product will be used in practice.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#top-6-searches","title":"Top #6 Searches","text":"<p>Keywords \"Automatic Trash Can/Self Tying Trash Can\"</p> <p>Search Results Links : 1. \"Automatic Trash can\" 2. \"Self tying trash can\" 3. \"Self sealing trash can\" 4. \"Touchless smart trash can self sealing\" 5. \"Automatic trash can \" 6. \"Motion Sensor Automatic Trash Can\"</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#selected-products","title":"Selected Products","text":"<ol> <li>\"Automtic Trash can\"</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Price: $74.99</li> <li>Vendor: Amazon</li> <li>Description: 13 Gal. / 49 Liter Stainless Steel Household Metal Trash Can with Sensor Lid and Odor Filter</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#positive-comments","title":"POSITIVE COMMENTS","text":"Voice of the Customer Restated Customer Need \u201cProduct broke after a few months. It was still under warranty, but they want the consumer to pay them an extra $15 to fix their mistakes. Also it smudges, doesn\u2019t eliminate odor, and the motion sensor frequently sets itself off. They decided to put the close button and the locking mechanism on opposite sides of the sensor, so when you press the close button it immediately reopens when you move your hand to lock the lid. This a bad product sold by an even worse company.\u201d Product should last longer than a few months,  Product should not stain easily,  The product\u2019s sensors should only go off when desired,   Product should have intuitive design. \u201cThe product description states 13 gallon however, the actual size is much smaller. I would have returned the item due to the ridiculous size difference but my husband had already torn the box and Home Depot stated I couldn\u2019t return it without the box. It was a project just to assemble the trash can as well. Too many tiny screws!!!\u201d The product should be clear in its sizing,  The product should be easy to assemble for the customer,  The product should be easy to assemble for the customer \u201cNOT WORTH THE PRICE. I never ordered a trash bin before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I assumed that a 13 gallon was the average size for kitchen trash bins but this just seems extremely small to me. I made this purchase knowing that it was motion sensing and odorless technology so I expected it to either be battery operated or plug - in. It is plug in... But you have to purchase the AC adapter separately as well as everything else that makes it \"techy\". So for the price I paid I just received a regular trash bin that I have to manually open and deal with smells unless I buy the rest of the kit. I'll be returning this as soon as possible and I will purchase a regular trash bin instead for much cheaper. Lesson learned.\u201d The product should not be too small to be used,   The product should be able to easily be powered,  The product should be battery operated or plug into a power source.

You have to purchase 4 D batteries and or online get an adapter that is made for it.\u201d The product is easy to recharge \u201cThe can arrived packaged very well. This is very important because you aren't immediately worried about a damaged product. This is a very sturdy and decorative indoor waste can. Easy to clean. I love how the cover opens and closes automatically ( I purchased the adapter) and that it has its own deodorizer.

Its slim and sleek design fits perfectly next to my kitchen setup without being an eyesore. What really sets it apart are the high-tech features: it seals itself with heat, lifts and lowers automatically, and even replaces the bag\u2014super cool! My only minor complaint is that I wish the opening were a bit wider. The Motion sensor works accordingly and it seems to be sturdy. I purchased this item on sale so the value for me was okay.\u201d The product should be sleek.  The product should automatically do as many tasks as possible.  The product\u2019s opening should be wide.  The product should be priced as low as possible. \u201cI really love this garbage can. Once I figured out what \u201cfull\u201d looks like for the automatic sealing mechanism, it\u2019s been everything I hoped for. A helpful tip: if the bag doesn\u2019t cut cleanly after sealing, it\u2019s probably slightly overfilled\u2014just press down the top a bit manually, and it should work perfectly.    One of the best features is the rechargeable battery. I honestly forget it even needs charging because it lasts for months\u2014I think it\u2019s been at least 3 months since the last charge.   The lights inside the can are a cute touch, though they\u2019re more for novelty than practical use. I did knock off one star because the motion sensor isn\u2019t quite sensitive enough. I usually have to wave my hand right up close\u2014or even touch it\u2014to get the lid to open. Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic product with smart features and a sleek design. Just wish the motion sensor worked a little better!\u201d The product should have a long battery life.  The product should allow the user to correct basic mistakes.  The product should provide illumination.  The product\u2019s sensors should be sensitive enough to properly detect what they are looking for. \u201cHad this trash can for well over a year now. So much better than Simple Human. Love that out has an open lid mode and bags the trash and refills the bag. It talks to me like a robot. Super awesome. Also freaks out the cat, which is always amusing. The sensor also works consistently, unlike our SH can in the kitchen. Also like that is rechargeable and I don't have to recharge it often; I recharge it a few times a year. This trash can is just cool - I LOVE IT! \u2764\ufe0f Smart people designed it.\u201d The product\u2019s sensors should work consistently.  The product should be power efficient.  The product should last for as long as possible.","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#negative-comments_2","title":"NEGATIVE COMMENTS","text":"Voice of the Customer Restated Customer Need \u201cComplete rip off, do not buy. 1st, I've never understood why vendors will sometimes take a small box and put it inside a box 3x its size without padding to ship an item. This is far worse than just shipping the original box on its own. The item is going to bang around inside that larger box and the shippers have no idea the thing that matters is inside the larger box. So naturally it came and the interior box that was taped up 1000x to hold it together for shipping was super damaged. This is the mark of a company that has no idea what its doing. Secondly, I have never, in trying 5 times, had a bag seal itself up after pressing the button. It opens and the bag is 30% sealed and that seal breaks as soon as you look at it. Thirdly, the opening to this trash bin is too narrow so its often not very helpful when you want to dispose of trash. Fourthly, the sensor used to open the top lid is often on strike. It simply refuses to acknowledge my presence. I need to perform some type of ritualistic dance to get the thing to open up .\u201d The product should be able to ship without damage.  The product should be able to perform its functions reliably.  The product should be sized properly for its function.  The sensors for the product should function reliably. \u201cI had high hopes for the Airdeer Automatic Trash Can, but unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its promising features, this 4-gallon self-sealing and self-changing smart trash can has not lived up to my expectations.\u201d The product should promptly respond to the user. The product should have its mechanisms work reliably. \u201cFirstly, the motion sensor is extremely finicky. Sometimes it responds, but more often than not, I find myself waving my hand multiple times just to get it to open. This defeats the purpose of a touchless trash can and has become quite frustrating.\u201d The product should not have flimsy components \u201cThe self-sealing and self-changing mechanism is another major issue. It frequently jams and fails to seal properly, leaving me with a mess to clean up. The trash bags are also quite flimsy and tear easily, which is not what I expected from a product designed for convenience.\u201d The product has multiple design flaws that make it not work properly. \u201cAdditionally, the lid doesn't always close securely, leading to unpleasant odors escaping into the kitchen. For a trash can with a lid, this is a fundamental flaw.\u201d The product should have easily replaceable and cheap internals, if they need to be replaced at all \u201cThe refill rings are supposed to make things easier, but they are overpriced and don't last nearly as long as advertised. I find myself constantly needing to replace them, adding to the overall cost and hassle.\u201d The product's complements are not worth their price <ol> <li>\"Touchless smart trash can self sealing\"</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Price: $139.00</li> <li>Vendor: Airdeer</li> <li>Description: Self-seal the trash bag by one touch Self-change a new bag Install the refill ring once, 20 days of use Flip lid opens in 0.15s by IR motion sensor Easy to understand with voice prompts Charge 7 hours, use for 90-180 days Also a new option for buying diaper pails</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#positive-comments_3","title":"POSITIVE COMMENTS","text":"Voice of the Customer Restated Customer Need \u201cOpens automatically and also seals the bag when full.

this project, a brainstorming session was needed to generate input for three sketches of a self-locking trash can. The first step in brainstorming was to decide on a starting concept. From this initial conversation, ideas emerged such as a product that helps organize the home, a home cleaning device, and finally, a self-locking trash can. The idea we ultimately settled on was the one we ultimately chose.</p> <p>Once the concept was chosen, market research and market offerings were conducted. This research was conducted individually and online. All results were recorded in a group Google Docs. This research provided us with five products with multiple positive and negative reviews. We then held an in-person meeting where we divided the work of sorting through these reviews into functional concepts from which to base the brainstorming session. Once the draw was over, a group meeting was held in the library where we organized ourselves to evaluate our areas of opportunity in relation to our teamwork and discuss how to carry out the \"Team Design Ideation\" activity.</p> <p>From this concept drawing, a list of 100 areas of opportunity emerged. Since our group consisted of four members, we each chose five areas of opportunity that were relatively different from each other and deconstructed each one into five ways to solve or attack it. This left us with a list of 100 data points. Once step two was completed, we divided into subgroups to cover more in less time. The \"subgroup\" in charge of step three was Riley and Alessandro. They were in charge of collecting and categorizing the list of 100 data points into six groups. Once the 100 points were analyzed, Riley and Alessandro worked on forming groups or categories to encompass this data. Finally, the list was reduced to six groups, into which the data were divided according to their respective categories without repeating categories. Once this was completed, it was decided to rank each feature on a scale of 1 to 10. This was done by asking a third party, who was unfamiliar with the activity and/or product, and asking them to give a rating from 1 to 10 according to the respective category.</p> <p>After reviewing the top-ranked ideas and combining them in different ways, they came up with three product ideas. These were used as the basis for part 4. Hattie reviewed the groups initially created for step 3 to gain a better understanding when visually capturing the three product ideas in three different vector drawings. Finally, in step 5, Gael gathered all the information from the Google Docs where the process and results of all the previous steps were compiled and created a duplicate on our group's GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":"<p>The block diagram was designed with ease of connectivity in mind.

Each message was structured to include only the necessary information for triggering actions, such as lid opening or fullness notifications, to reduce the chance of errors or miscommunication. During the design process, we iteratively refined the block diagram as a team, discussing how each sensor\u2019s data would flow through the system and how messages would be formatted to maintain reliability and clarity. This approach enabled us to establish a consistent and easy-to-understand communication structure that could be implemented directly in our code and hardware.</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#top-5-biggest-changes-to-software-design","title":"Top 5 Biggest Changes to Software Design","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Added a second sensor    Originally, the system used only one sensor for detecting both motion and fullness. We realized that separating the sensors would better fit the project requirements. By introducing a second sensor, each microcontroller now handles two inputs, making the software more complex to write and debug. </p> </li> <li> <p>Reassigned Sensors    To improve subsystem organization, the sensors were moved to Hattie\u2019s board. This required reassigning pins and updating the software to match the new hardware connections. The change ensures cleaner separation of hardware responsibilities and reduces wiring complexity, which in turn simplifies code maintenance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Changed pin types (digital \u2194 analog)    During the reorganization, some pins originally configured as digital needed to be analog, and vice versa, depending on the sensor requirements. Updating the pin types in the code ensured that the microcontrollers read correct values from each sensor. This adjustment reduced misreadings and simplified the software logic for handling inputs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified channel switching    With multiple sensors on separate channels, the previous complex switching routines were no longer necessary. The code was simplified to read each sensor independently, avoiding timing conflicts or interference. This improves overall responsiveness and reliability, as documented in Hattie\u2019s website with the sensor channel switching implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved subsystem connection mapping    Updating the software to match the reorganized block diagram clarified the relationships between sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators. This ensures that data flows correctly between subsystems and that signals trigger actions accurately. The UML diagrams were revised to reflect these changes, making it easier to maintain and extend the code in future iterations.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/","title":"Software Design","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#software-design","title":"Software Design","text":"<p>This activity diagram illustrates the software workflow for the motion sensor, weight sensor, distance sensor, and motor/LED control logic. The logic was decided upon during the initial formation of the idea, and simply elaborated upon for the formal software proposal. The main loop, on the left side, represents the overall flow of the project, cycling the sensors and actuators. The details of each microcontroller (MCU) are elaborated on the right. The microcontroller subsystems appear in the order they are shown on the diagram, and are numbered in the order they appear on the block diagram. The software meets the product requirements by connecting all the team's microcontrollers together, and by enabling the proper sensing and actuating on each member's subsystem.</p> <p></p> <p>Potential for improvement:</p> <p>If this software were to undergo improvements, there are multiple avenues to streamline the software process. One primary change would be to connect the motion and distance subsystem to all three other microcontrollers, and eliminate the connection between the LED scale and force sensor subsystem and the speaker subsystem. This was initially done because the team had already set up the connections, but were told that we had to change our subsystems in order to fulfill class requirements. This led to the inefficient connection, which should be removed if there was another opportunity to connect to update the design. In addition, the exact weight metrics should be ironed out in order to be able to accommodate multiple different bag strengths, and accurately identify them using the force sensor. Another change would be to the logic of the speaker. Ideally, the speaker should serve as a reminder that the trash is full, and the bag needs to be replaced. However, the current set up only has the speaker go off once when the trash can is full. Ideally, a different timer would be added to the speaker to go off once every few minutes, or a few times an hour, in order to serve as a more persistent reminder to the consumer, rather than a single warning.</p>"},{"location":"08-Resources/","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#resources","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#finals-images-of-the-system","title":"Finals images of the system","text":"<p>Team207_bread board images.zip</p>"},{"location":"08-Resources/#video-documentation-of-the-final-system-working","title":"Video Documentation of the final system working","text":"<p>Team207_vid_demo.zip</p>"},{"location":"08-Resources/#additional-files","title":"Additional files","text":"<p>Vector Drawings zip</p>"},{"location":"09-Reflection/","title":"Reflection","text":""},{"location":"09-Reflection/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":""},{"location":"09-Reflection/#lessons-learned","title":"Lessons Learned","text":"<p>A lo largo de este semestre hemos atravesado m\u00faltiples vivencias que nos han ense\u00f1ado alternativas o maneras m\u00e1s eficientes de trabajar y conseguir resultados. Ense\u00f1anzas que a futuro son valiosas, son experiencia. Se pueden recalcar cosas tan b\u00e1sicas como la puntualidad o comunicaci\u00f3n o conceptos m\u00e1s complicados como el uso adecuado del equipo de trabajo en el laboratorio y fuera de \u00e9l. Una de las lecciones m\u00e1s importantes  que aprendimos fue el manejo del tiempo. Si se mantiene un buen paso de trabajo y se toman en cuenta las fechas de entrega, el tiempo se vuelve libre y no una carga. EGR es un curso cargado donde se combinan laboratorios en hardware y software, dise\u00f1o y construcci\u00f3n de circuitos y c\u00f3digo, para esto es recomendable sino necesario revisar el contenido durante tiempo fuera de clase. El trabajo en equipo es una de las \u00e1reas m\u00e1s importantes de ingenier\u00eda, y no se presenta en mayor cantidad y calidad que cuando se necesita el apoyo externo. Poder aprender, pedir ayuda de tus compa\u00f1eros de equipo o compa\u00f1eros de clase y poder brindar apoyo a ellos tambi\u00e9n, son herramientas como ninguna otra. Otra cosa a tomar en cuenta es trabajar con piezas o componentes limitados, siempre que sea posible se debe tomar en cuenta el posible error humano y trabajar alrededor de ellos. Pueden ser cosas sencillas como la p\u00e9rdida de piezas o el mal trato accidental a estas. </p> <p>A todo esto se debe agregar la complejidad del software necesario para esta clase. El software utilizado en esta clase es sencillo de usar pero la opini\u00f3n popular suele ser compleja para nuevos ingresos o nuevos con dichos softwares y requiere de tiempo y trabajo para familiarizarse con dichos. Al dise\u00f1ar el producto inicial se es necesario no solo tomar en cuenta la que se desea crear si no tambi\u00e9n la dificultad que conlleva dicho  proyecto y consciencia de las capacidades individuales y colectivas de cada miembro del grupo. En nuestro caso buscamos algo que se considerara sencillo de realizar pero que a\u00fan mantuviera un buen nivel de reto para nosotros. Ser consciente de las capacidades de uno mismo  es muy importante. Pues clases como esta no son lo \u00fanico que existe en el mundo, posee una vida social, personal y en casos laborar que se necesita balancear junto con la acad\u00e9mica. Y se necesita ser capaz de mantener un equilibrio para poder desempe\u00f1arse de la mejor manera posible..</p>"},{"location":"09-Reflection/#recommendations-for-future-students","title":"Recommendations for Future Students","text":"<ol> <li>Dedicate 1 to 2 hours before each lab to review the course material and get ahead in the learning process to perform more efficiently.</li> <li>Maintaining effective communication with teammates is crucial for good performance.</li> <li>The goal should be to work ahead.

The biggest improvement would be separating the design into two PCBs. Even though the schematic shows the sensors near each other, the motion sensor and depth sensor must be placed in completely different locations inside the trash can. Using a single PCB forces long wire runs, which can introduce electrical noise, complicate installation, and increase the risk of wires bending or breaking over time. Adding a dedicated \u201clid PCB\u201d for the motion sensor and a separate \u201cbin PCB\u201d for the depth sensor would shorten wiring, reduce noise, and simplify assembly.</p> <p>By giving each sensor its own board and its own channel, the microcontroller no longer has to manage overlapping readings or deal with interference caused by long wires. This reduces the chance of inaccurate sensor values, unstable analog readings, or accidental triggering when switching channels. With cleaner, isolated signals, the software can rely on simple ADC reads and basic thresholds without additional filtering or compensation. This makes the code easier to write, easier to debug, and far more stable during normal operation.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]}]}
