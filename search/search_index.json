It was still under warranty, but they want the consumer to pay them an extra $15 to fix their mistakes. Also it smudges, doesn\u2019t eliminate odor, and the motion sensor frequently sets itself off. They decided to put the close button and the locking mechanism on opposite sides of the sensor, so when you press the close button it immediately reopens when you move your hand to lock the lid. This a bad product sold by an even worse company.\u201d Product should last longer than a few months,  Product should not stain easily,  The product\u2019s sensors should only go off when desired,   Product should have intuitive design. \u201cThe product description states 13 gallon however, the actual size is much smaller.

I never ordered a trash bin before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I assumed that a 13 gallon was the average size for kitchen trash bins but this just seems extremely small to me. I made this purchase knowing that it was motion sensing and odorless technology so I expected it to either be battery operated or plug - in. It is plug in... But you have to purchase the AC adapter separately as well as everything else that makes it \"techy\". So for the price I paid I just received a regular trash bin that I have to manually open and deal with smells unless I buy the rest of the kit. I'll be returning this as soon as possible and I will purchase a regular trash bin instead for much cheaper. Lesson learned.\u201d The product should not be too small to be used,   The product should be able to easily be powered,  The product should be battery operated or plug into a power source.

Its slim and sleek design fits perfectly next to my kitchen setup without being an eyesore. What really sets it apart are the high-tech features: it seals itself with heat, lifts and lowers automatically, and even replaces the bag\u2014super cool! My only minor complaint is that I wish the opening were a bit wider. The Motion sensor works accordingly and it seems to be sturdy. I purchased this item on sale so the value for me was okay.\u201d The product should be sleek.  The product should automatically do as many tasks as possible.  The product\u2019s opening should be wide.  The product should be priced as low as possible. \u201cI really love this garbage can. Once I figured out what \u201cfull\u201d looks like for the automatic sealing mechanism, it\u2019s been everything I hoped for. A helpful tip: if the bag doesn\u2019t cut cleanly after sealing, it\u2019s probably slightly overfilled\u2014just press down the top a bit manually, and it should work perfectly.    One of the best features is the rechargeable battery. I honestly forget it even needs charging because it lasts for months\u2014I think it\u2019s been at least 3 months since the last charge.   The lights inside the can are a cute touch, though they\u2019re more for novelty than practical use. I did knock off one star because the motion sensor isn\u2019t quite sensitive enough. I usually have to wave my hand right up close\u2014or even touch it\u2014to get the lid to open. Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic product with smart features and a sleek design. Just wish the motion sensor worked a little better!\u201d The product should have a long battery life.  The product should allow the user to correct basic mistakes.  The product should provide illumination.  The product\u2019s sensors should be sensitive enough to properly detect what they are looking for. \u201cHad this trash can for well over a year now. So much better than Simple Human. Love that out has an open lid mode and bags the trash and refills the bag. It talks to me like a robot. Super awesome. Also freaks out the cat, which is always amusing. The sensor also works consistently, unlike our SH can in the kitchen. Also like that is rechargeable and I don't have to recharge it often; I recharge it a few times a year. This trash can is just cool - I LOVE IT! \u2764\ufe0f Smart people designed it.\u201d The product\u2019s sensors should work consistently.  The product should be power efficient.

This is far worse than just shipping the original box on its own. The item is going to bang around inside that larger box and the shippers have no idea the thing that matters is inside the larger box. So naturally it came and the interior box that was taped up 1000x to hold it together for shipping was super damaged. This is the mark of a company that has no idea what its doing. Secondly, I have never, in trying 5 times, had a bag seal itself up after pressing the button. It opens and the bag is 30% sealed and that seal breaks as soon as you look at it. Thirdly, the opening to this trash bin is too narrow so its often not very helpful when you want to dispose of trash. Fourthly, the sensor used to open the top lid is often on strike. It simply refuses to acknowledge my presence. I need to perform some type of ritualistic dance to get the thing to open up .\u201d The product should be able to ship without damage.  The product should be able to perform its functions reliably.  The product should be sized properly for its function.  The sensors for the product should function reliably. \u201cI had high hopes for the Airdeer Automatic Trash Can, but unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its promising features, this 4-gallon self-sealing and self-changing smart trash can has not lived up to my expectations.\u201d The product should promptly respond to the user. The product should have its mechanisms work reliably. \u201cFirstly, the motion sensor is extremely finicky. Sometimes it responds, but more often than not, I find myself waving my hand multiple times just to get it to open. This defeats the purpose of a touchless trash can and has become quite frustrating.\u201d The product should not have flimsy components \u201cThe self-sealing and self-changing mechanism is another major issue. It frequently jams and fails to seal properly, leaving me with a mess to clean up. The trash bags are also quite flimsy and tear easily, which is not what I expected from a product designed for convenience.\u201d The product has multiple design flaws that make it not work properly. \u201cAdditionally, the lid doesn't always close securely, leading to unpleasant odors escaping into the kitchen. For a trash can with a lid, this is a fundamental flaw.\u201d The product should have easily replaceable and cheap internals, if they need to be replaced at all \u201cThe refill rings are supposed to make things easier, but they are overpriced and don't last nearly as long as advertised. I find myself constantly needing to replace them, adding to the overall cost and hassle.\u201d The product's complements are not worth their price <ol> <li>\"Touchless smart trash can self sealing\"</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Price: $139.00</li> <li>Vendor: Airdeer</li> <li>Description: Self-seal the trash bag by one touch Self-change a new bag Install the refill ring once, 20 days of use Flip lid opens in 0.15s by IR motion sensor Easy to understand with voice prompts Charge 7 hours, use for 90-180 days Also a new option for buying diaper pails</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#positive-comments_3","title":"POSITIVE COMMENTS","text":"Voice of the Customer Restated Customer Need \u201cOpens automatically and also seals the bag when full.

While she has mild arthritis in both of her hands, she manages her day to day tasks with little difficulty. However, by the end of the week, taking out the trash becomes a challenging task. The action of pulling the drawstrings on a trash bag and tying them does cause her some discomfort in her hands. To ease this struggle, Harriet\u2019s new self seal trash can has no pull, no tie feature that lets her complete this chore with ease. This small improvement allows her to maintain her house with less discomfort.</p> <p>User Story #2: Sam</p> <p>Sam is a busy nursing student who works long shifts at a hospital. His days are packed with responsibilities, and when he's home, he tries his best to keep up with his household chores. One task he often forgets about is taking out the trash. By the time he gets to it, the smell can be unbearable, especially after a long shift. To make things easier, Sam uses a self-sealing trash can. When the bag reaches a certain fullness, it automatically seals itself shut, locking in any odors and preventing any mess from spilling over. This feature means Sam doesn't have to worry about forgetting to take the trash out immediately or dealing with lingering smells. The self sealing trash can gives him one less thing to worry about during his busy, tiring days.</p>"},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"<p>The new product design will be based on other automatic trash cans that were found on the internet, with improvements based on the following requirements.

<p>How you grouped features</p> <ul> <li>How you applied rankings to top ideas</li> </ul> <p>For this project, a brainstorming session was needed to generate input for three sketches of a self-locking trash can. The first step in brainstorming was to decide on a starting concept. From this initial conversation, ideas emerged such as a product that helps organize the home, a home cleaning device, and finally, a self-locking trash can. The idea we ultimately settled on was the one we ultimately chose.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once the concept was chosen, market research and market offerings were conducted. This research was conducted individually and online. All results were recorded in a group Google Docs. This research provided us with five products with multiple positive and negative reviews. We then held an in-person meeting where we divided the work of sorting through these reviews into functional concepts from which to base the brainstorming session. Once the draw was over, a group meeting was held in the library where we organized ourselves to evaluate our areas of opportunity in relation to our teamwork and discuss how to carry out the \"Team Design Ideation\" activity.</p> <p>From this concept drawing, a list of 100 areas of opportunity emerged. Since our group consisted of four members, we each chose five areas of opportunity that were relatively different from each other and deconstructed each one into five ways to solve or attack it. This left us with a list of 100 data points. Once step two was completed, we divided into subgroups to cover more in less time. The \"subgroup\" in charge of step three was Riley and Alessandro. They were in charge of collecting and categorizing the list of 100 data points into six groups. Once the 100 points were analyzed, Riley and Alessandro worked on forming groups or categories to encompass this data. Finally, the list was reduced to six groups, into which the data were divided according to their respective categories without repeating categories. Once this was completed, it was decided to rank each feature on a scale of 1 to 10.
